# Learn about the goal and outcome of the mission

The main intent of this scenario is to put an event-driven architecture into action by automating data and delta events through SAP Build Process Automation and also by building an extension application on SAP Business Technology Platform using SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) which consumes and further processes the SAP S/4HANA On-premise business events.

This application showcases:

- Building applications on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) using [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model(CAP)](../../discover/discover-cap)
- Consuming events from SAP S/4HANA on premise using [SAP Event Mesh](../../discover/sap-event-mesh)
- Consuming REST APIs from SAP S/4HANA on premise using SAP Business Technology Platform Connectivity Service
- [SAP Build Process Automation](../../discover/build-process-automation) (workflow, Forms, desicions, actions )

## Business Scenario

As Supplier Relationship Manager of ACME corporation Jane would like to have a curated mechanism to onboard new suppliers . The newly onboarded suppliers needs to go through multiple validations before ACME starts to do business with the supplier.

A Supplier Relationship executive would like to have a minimalistic form to onboard the business partner
Jane would like to get a notification for approval whenever a new Supplier is onboarded
ACME would like the Supplier to be validated by iCredible (Third-party Business Partner Validation firm)
John an employee iCredible (Third-party Business Partner Validation firm) would like to get notification when ever new suppliers are added to S/4 HANA system of ACME. John can then proceed to validate the business partner.
Once Johnâ€™s verification is completed, Jane would like to get a notification to approve and unblock payments and creation of purchase orders to the new Supplier

### Solution Diagram

The Business Partner Validation application is developed using the SAP Cloud Application programming Model (CAP) and runs on the SAP BTP,  Cloud Foundry runtime. It consumes platform services like SAP Event Mesh, SAP HANA and Connectivity. The events occuring in S/4 HANA on premise are inserted into the Event Mesh queue. The application running in Cloud Foundry is notified on events, consumes them from the queue and inserts the event data into the HANA database. The Business Partner Validation Application uses S/4 HANA REST API's to read additional Business Partner Data from the S/4 HANA system.
